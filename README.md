# Ethereum-Price-Bookie

## Summary
The Ethereum "Price Bookie" is a decentralized application that enables users to bet on the future price of ethereum. 

Each bet consists of...
- A bet amount (in ether)
- A price guess (in USD)
- A margin of error (in USD)
- Number of days in future bet will occur

If the price of Ethereum on the future date is within the margin of error of the bet, the user will receive a reward in ether.
The reward amount is a function of the size of the margin of error and the number of days in the future the bet takes place.
For example, a bet with a small margin of error and many days in the future will yield larger rewards than bets with a large
margin of error and only 1 or 2 days in the future.


The sole purpose of this project is to gain experience writing smart contracts in solidity and connecting them to a front-end application.
